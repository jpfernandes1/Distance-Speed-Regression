# Distance-Speed-Regression
This is a correlation analisys of the distance a car needs to stop at a given speed

Insights: 

The obtained correlation (R = 0.807) is classified as medium-hight.
Yet, calculating the coefficient of determination (RÂ² = 0.651) we can see that the model doesn't explain 
the values as well.

Almost all of the residues are located between -6 and 6.
